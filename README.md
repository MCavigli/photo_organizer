# Photo Organizer

This script is a simple organizer for a large collection of photos. The main file should be placed and run in a directory that contains photos that have a very specific naming convention that looks like this:

- 2020-05-11.jpg
- 2020-05-01.jpg
- 2020-11-22.png
- 2021-01-01.mov
- 2022-02-15.jpeg

The file name must begin with a **year** followed by a dash then a **month**. The file can end in one of these files formats:

- .jpg
- .png
- .jpeg
- .mov

## What does it do?

This will create a file structure based on the year and month the photo was taken. It will organize photos into a directory with the year as the directory's title then subdirectories titled after the month.

I'm not sure if this is the best way to organize photos. I'm thinking about organizing photos by seasons/quarters of the year instead of individual months.
